# Q 3.21 Solution (Collatz Conjecture sequence)

Note: All the information written below is specific to Ubuntu operating system


## Requirements
Ubuntu operating system and GCC compiler to compile the C code.

[Steps to install GCC compiler on Ubuntu](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-ubuntu-18-04/#installing-gcc-on-ubuntu)

## Steps to run the programs

### Solution.c
 - Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the file **Solution.c** is present
-  gcc solution.c
- ./a.out


**Output**

## Implementation
- This C program creates child process and this child process is responsible for printing the Collatz Conjecture sequence .
- In linux os fork() system call is used to create child process.
- Once the parent process calls fork() system call then parents wait for child process to complete the work assigned by calling wait(NULL) system call.
- This code is applicable only for non negative integers as input.

## About fork() system call
-Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call.
-A child process uses the same pc(program counter), same CPU registers, same open files which use in the parent process.

-It takes no parameters and returns an integer value. 
- Negative Value: creation of a child process was unsuccessful.
- Zero: Returned to the newly created child process.
- Positive value: Returned to parent or caller. The value contains process ID of newly created child process.

## About wait() system call
A call to wait() blocks the calling process until one of its child processes exits or a signal is received. After child process terminates, parent continues its execution after wait system call instruction. 

Child process may terminate due to any of these: 
- It calls exit();
- It returns (an int) from main
- It receives a signal (from the OS or another process) whose default action is to terminate.

## Inference
The child process created by parent process is able to print the Collatz Conjecture sequence and once the child process exits then the parent comes out of waiting state and exectues rest of the code.
